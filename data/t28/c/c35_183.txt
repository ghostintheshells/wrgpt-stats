% Well crud. My plan had been to jam this river whether I hit the flush or
% not, but now I've acquired some showdown value. Where before my only
% chance to win was to bet, I've now pulled ahead of JJ, TT, and the like.
% If you have Kc xc, I'm going to feel a little guilty about sucking out
% on you.

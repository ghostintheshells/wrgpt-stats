TOURNEY INFORMATION

NOTICE:

This is the REAL WRGPT23.
Email changes and office day changes do NOT carry over from the practice round.
You are NOT allowed to play more than one stack.
Your ID has changed.  Please make sure it does NOT start with a "p" as that was for practice.

Starting the tourney on a holiday (11/11) caused many tables to not be forced to start at the 
end of the first day as it has in previous days.  They will start at the end of the first 
non-holiday day which is 11/12.

REMEMBER: You only get FOUR hours to act this year in your office day.

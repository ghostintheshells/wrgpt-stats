TOURNEY INFORMATION

NOTICE:


This is the REAL WRGPT22.

If your ID starts with a "p" is it not the right one.

Any ADDR or START of day settings you made in the practice round DO NOT
carry over to the real tourney and will need to be made again.

PLEASE understand the timeout rules and re-check your history before
you protest and stop the table.  Almost all protests are people not
understanding timeouts or not noticing that their turn had already
come back around.

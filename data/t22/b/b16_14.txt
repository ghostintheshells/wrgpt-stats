TOURNEY INFORMATION

NOTICE:


When a live redraw is in progress your table may finish a hand and
then wait for an empty spot to open up or wait for an incoming player
before starting the next hand.  This is normal.  This usually takes
less than a couple of hours but can stretch for a day or more if the
timing isn't optimal.

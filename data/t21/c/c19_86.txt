TOURNEY INFORMATION

NOTICE:


The dealer had problems starting the afternoon of 1/30.
It may take a day or two for everything to normalize.

MANY tables had HANDS MISDEALT and a new hand RESTARTED
with the same HAND NUMBER.  This is obviously not right.
However, play the NEW cards sent and consider the first
cards sent a misdeal.

A status command "WHAT" is being sent to all players
so that confusion is helped.

If you are still not sure please send a WHAT command to 
make sure you are acting on the correct hand with the 
correct cards.

Timeouts will be no longer disabled.  Please play quickly
as a courtesy to the other players at your table.

Having problems? Send email to floorman21@wrgpt.org.

TOURNEY INFORMATION

NOTICE:


The dealer had problems starting the afternoon of 1/30.
It may take a day or two for everything to normalize.

MANY tables had HANDS MISDEALT and a new hand RESTARTED
with the same HAND NUMBER.  This is obviously not right.
However, play the NEW cards sent and consider the first
cards sent a misdeal.

A status command "WHAT" is being sent to all players
so that confusion is helped.

If you are still not sure please send a WHAT command to 
make sure you are acting on the correct hand with the 
correct cards.

Timeouts will be disabled for any timeout happening on
Tuesday 1/31/2012.  Timeouts happening on Wednesday 2/1/2012
will likely happen normally unless other problems are discovered.

If you still see problems send email to the floorman.

Having problems? Send email to floorman21@wrgpt.org.

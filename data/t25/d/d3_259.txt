_____________________________________________________________________________

! I screwed up. Somehow I thought one of the large stacks
! had min raised. If I knew it was you I would have jammed
! figuring you would have just given it up... With a moderate
! raise you probably figured I didn't have a huge hand (which
! I didn't).
! but I hate you anyway

! 02/03/16 17:20:33! Quick folds

! was a win-win for me. Either I beat you, which is nice, or I don't have 
! play a small stack any more, which is OK too.

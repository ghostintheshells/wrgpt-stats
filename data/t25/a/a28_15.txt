TOURNEY INFORMATION

NOTICE:

This is the PRACTICE Round.  It will last about two weeks
and could stop or restart suddenly to fix issues if found.

The WRGPT real tourney was originally scheduled to start 10/19.  
However, the service provider for the server has scheduled an 
upgrade for that day so we are going to wait until that upgrade 
has completed and we are convinced it has no effect on WRGPT.  
This may take only a day or as long as a week.

Good luck.
